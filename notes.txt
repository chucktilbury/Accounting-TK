Add the product attribute to the sale record form. Sale items are attributed
to a customer and connected to the sale record. Add a dialog to associate and
view sale items with a sale in the sale import form.
    Need a "populate" function for the line box. Such that previously saved
    sale items will appear in the list with the quantity for that sale. Then
    needs to properly update/insert the record as need be.

    The populate function only needs to happen when creating a report or when
    entering a sale record by hand. It is not needed for importing sales.

Purchase notes hold what was actually bought. This requires hand editing. not
sure how to do it otherwise.

Do not add sales to cash until the order has shipped. Need to add a "Sale"
account as a liability to hold unfulfilled sales.

Add dialog the tells user that the database is being created.
